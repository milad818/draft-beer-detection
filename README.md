# Draft Beer Detection

## Brief Overview

The draft beer detection task in machine learning typically refers to using computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify and analyze beer served from a tap.

## The Data

There are four kinds of draft beer: Chimay Blue, Orval, Rochefort 10, Westmalle Tripel and Westvleteren 12. The classes are numbered 0 to 4 respectively. These class numbers are necessary to create a correct classifier. The code to load the images into NumPy arrays is written `trainer/data.py`.
